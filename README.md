# ViVe
ViVe is a C# library you can use to make your own programs that interact with the A/B feature experiment mechanism found in Windows 10 & newer.

In case you'd like to talk to NTDLL exports directly, you can use its *NativeMethods*.

Otherwise, *RtlFeatureManager* offers the same featureset with the benefit of some struct heavy lifting being done for you.

# ViVeTool
ViVeTool is both an example of how to use ViVe, as well as a straightforward tool for power users which want to use the new APIs instantly.
